## GitHub API endpoint

Programatic access to GitHub is done via the v3 API:

- https://developer.github.com/v3/

```
curl -i https://api.github.com/users/ilg-ul/orgs

curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases

curl -v -X GET https://api.github.com/repos/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/hooks
```

For authenticated requests, preferably create a new token and pass it
via the environment.

- https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication

## Trigger GitHub action

To trigger a GitHub action it is necessary to send an authenticated POST
at a specific URL:

- https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event

```
curl \
  --include \
  --header "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_API_DISPATCH_TOKEN}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
  --data '{"event_type": "on-demand-test", "client_payload": {}}' \
  https://api.github.com/repos/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/dispatches
```

The request should return `HTTP/1.1 204 No Content`.

The repository should have an action with `on: repository_dispatch`.
