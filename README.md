# The xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC

This open source project provides the platform specific binaries for the
[xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/);
it is hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack).

This distribution plans to follow the official
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
distribution, by Arm.

The binaries can be installed automatically as **binary xPacks** or manually as
**portable archives**.

In addition to the package meta data, this project also includes
the build scripts.

## User info

This section is intended as a shortcut for those who plan
to use the GNU Arm Embedded GCC binaries. For full details please read the
[xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/) pages.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install GNU Arm Embedded GCC is using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

#### Prerequisites

The only requirement is a recent
`xpm`, which is a portable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) command line application. To install it,
follow the instructions from the
[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

#### Install

With the `xpm` tool available, installing
the latest version of the package is quite easy:

```console
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest
```

This command will always install the latest available version,
into the central xPacks repository, which is a platform dependent folder
(check the output of the `xpm` command for the actual folder used on
your platform, and mind the hidden `.content` folder).

This location is configurable using the environment variable
`XPACKS_REPO_FOLDER`; for more details please check the
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.

xPacks aware tools, like the **GNU MCU Eclipse plug-ins** automatically
identify binaries installed with
`xpm` and provide a convenient method to manage paths.

#### Uninstall

To remove the installed xPack, the command is similar:

```console
$ xpm uninstall --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

(Note: not yet implemented. As a temporary workaround, simply remove the
`xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc` folder, or one of the the versioned
subfolders.)

### Manual install

For all platforms, the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** binaries are released as portable
archives that can be installed in any location.

The archives can be downloaded from the
GitHub [releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/releases/) page.

For more details please read the [Install](https://xpack.github.io/arm-none-eabi-gcc/install/) page.
